# Minimal :: A Shader Driven WebGPU Framework ðŸ’Ž

Minimal is thin layer of abstraction on top of WebGPU with the purpose of making Shader Programming, GPU Simulations and Parallel Programming much easier.

At the core of minimal, is an idea called Shader Driven Programming, which allows you to create and control your GPU resources dynamically.

Minimal introduces **MSL** (Minimal Shading Language) which is a **superset of WGSL** (the shading language of WebGPU).
